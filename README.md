Please use this app to scaffold a Node JS app to make API requests directly to a Shopify store.  In this example, this app takes in an object that contains the credentials of a specific store, and an array of customerIds checks if each customer at the specified store has "Net Terms" as a tag.  If it does, then no update is made.  If it does not exist, then "Net Terms" added.
